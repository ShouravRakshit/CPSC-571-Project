# Project Title
Recommending Movie Actors To Match Role Descriptions

Our teamâ€™s research focus is an improvement on existing implementations of Recommendation Systems that make use of free-text user input. The use-case we will be deploying this solution in is recommending actors based on role descriptions, but overall the solution will be capable of being deployed for any recommendation working off of free-text input. The motivation behind this is that with the large number of movies and potential actors it becomes hard to find actors that match role descriptions as finding the best (available) actor from a sea of actors is nearly impossible for a human. With this recommendation system this reduces the need for searching and reviewing just put in the role description and our system will provide a list of acceptable actors that can work in the role description.
